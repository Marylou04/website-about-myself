          <h3>Musical Accomplishments</h3>
          <p>Music has been a part of my life since I can remember. I have participated in several music competitions and won the first prize many times. When I was 15 I got accepted into a gifted program called <i>Exellenzcluster Musik </i> at the <i>Gustav Mahler Private University for Music</i> and studied clarinet besides attending High School.</p>

          <h3>Quick Learning</h3>
          <p>I do well in understanding things quickly, especially languages. Whenever I need to comprehend something, my brain absorbs information like a sponge. For example, I lived with a Russian host family for 8 months and I was able to understad 90% of what they were saying as well as speak basic sentences.</p>
